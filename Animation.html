        <h2>Nine Days of MAA DURGA</h2>
        <h3>
            <p>The festival is devoted to goddess Durga, whose nine forms are worshipped on nine days.<br>
                 The last day is also Rama Navami, the birthday of Rama. For this reason, it is also called Rama Navaratri by some people.<br>
             In many regions, the festival falls after spring harvest, and in others, during harvest.</p>
        </h3>

            <p>
                The festival is associated to the prominent battle that took place between Durga and the demon Mahishasura to celebrate the victory of good over evil.<br>
             These nine days are solely dedicated to Durga and her nine avatars â€“ the Navadurga.The specific forms of navadurga are extracted from the Devikavaca, a subsection of the Devipurana text and representative of a major aspect in the life of the goddess, Parvati.<br>

            <h3>
              Each day is associated to an incarnation of the goddess:
